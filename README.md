# Hi!

This is a repository for my C# exam taking place on December 20, 2024 from 9 AM to... evening (yes... 9+ hours....). 

## Task description
Quiz WebApp
Create a simple quiz and poll web app. Create a quiz, answer the latest quiz. Quiz questions should be of multiple-choice type (ie many choices, only one can be selected - radio buttons). One answer can be marked as the correct choice during quiz creation for statistics (but not mandatory, some quizzes do not have any correct answers - polls for example). The front page shows statistics/results of all the quizzes and possibility to go answer to the latest quiz (when answering questions, it is easier to program answering one question at a time). Generally speaking - these are only broad guidelines. Please write a solution that you would like to present to the world as your best effort in programming and app-designing (UX is the key).
Web app has to allow:
Quiz CRUD, with quiz headline, questions and possible answer choices
Quiz statistics
Quiz filtering/searching on frontpage

## Structure

- EF core and SQLite for DB

## Please notice
This is an exam submission - please do not clone or copy!
